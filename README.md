# Connecting PROTEAN-CR with other tools in the ITCR Network

Repository that connects PROTEAN-CR to other related tools in the ITCR Network!

## Usage

There are two ways to use this particular repo:
1) Using the binder link here:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KavrakiLab/EnGens/binder?labpath=Workflow1-FeatureExtraction.ipynb)
The current binder repo contains two examples:
- One examples that runs APE-Gen2.0 with a selected peptide and MHC allele.
- One example that scans the **CEDAR database** for *Hepatitis B-derived peptides* and models these peptides structurally with APE-Gen2.0. Such a workflow can be easily customized for peptides of different origins (viral, tumor). 

2) Downloading the repo and run examples locally. This requires a local installation of [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), as well as a local installation of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
